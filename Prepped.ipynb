However, in the case of imbalanced classes this metric can be misleading, as high scores do not show prediction capacity for the minority class. One may have a 99% accuracy but a low prediction capacity on the class they are truly interested in (eg. anomaly detection where anomalies are rare classes in a dataset). \n",
