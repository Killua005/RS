## PROJECT GOALS
## Objectives

- Identify factors responsible for most of the reported accidents.
- Build a machine learning model that is capable of accurately predicting the severity of an accident.
- Provide recommendations to the Department of Transport (UK Government) to improve road safety policies and prevent recurrences of severe accidents where possible.


## PACKAGES USED
Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, Matplotlib

## MOTIVATION
World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 1.25 million people die each year while 50 million are injured as a result of road accidents worldwide. Road accidents are the 10th leading cause of death globally. On current trends, road traffic accidents are to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 making it a major public health concern. Between the years 2005 and 2016, there were roughly 2 million road accidents reported in the United Kingdom (UK) alone of which 16,000 were fatal.

As a big data project, We wanted to explore the traffic demographics data in greater detail using machine learning
